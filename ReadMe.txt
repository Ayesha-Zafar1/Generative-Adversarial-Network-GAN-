Assignment Tasks: Implementation of DCGAN Architecture and Mutilabel Classifier

There are two tasks implemented in two different .py files named as: 
-> MSDS23011_05_task1_part1.py
-> MSDS23011_05_task1_part2.py

with two .ipynb files named as:
-> MSDS23011_05_task1_part1.ipynb
-> MSDS23011_05_task1_part2.ipynb


System requirements and Installation:
To run these files on your systems there are few requirements, which are given below:
1. Google Colab
2. Install the libraries used in these files like:
    -> numpy
    -> pandas
    -> sklearn
    -> Pytorch
    -> matplotlib etc.
 Note: You can install it using "pip install"
 
 4. After the installation of libraries and important packages, you just need to run it to get the results.
 5. I also saved my trained models, losses, weights and generated images in save_dir.zip, and save_dir2.zip files attached in this folder.
 6. There is a report attached in this folder too with my results.
